# Tech videos
This project aims to help you better organize sessions where you watch tech videos together with your team 
(or any video with any group of people). Users can submit, browse and vote for suggested videos.
An organizer will then close the votes by starting a session.

This is a UI for the amazing [tech-videos api](https://github.com/nWidart/tech-videos).
The swagger is available [here](http://128.199.55.146/swagger-ui.html#).
